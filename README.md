# Problem-sheet-1
# In the pdf file, you find the exercise. After the submit deadline of sheet 1 (14th of September, 12 pm), we will upload a python file as a sample solution. If you find mistakes in that solution, or even better, if you think that you found a better solution, please hand in your suggestion as a branch here in GitHub.
